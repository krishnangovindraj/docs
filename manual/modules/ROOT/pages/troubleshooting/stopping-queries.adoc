= Stopping queries

If a query runs indefinitely, you may need to stop it before proceeding with xref:{page-version}@manual::troubleshooting/debugging-queries.adoc[debugging].
This page provides general guidelines for safely terminating queries in different TypeDB clients.

[#query_interruption]
== Is it safe to interrupt queries?

Yes.
Read queries do not alter the database and can be stopped safely at any time.
Schema and write queries also do not affect the database until they are <<commit_interruption, committed>>, making it safe to terminate them as well.

== Stop a query through TypeDB clients

[NOTE]
====
Currently, queries cannot be stopped while execution.
Coming soon!

== Nothing Works?

If other methods fail, you can stop or kill the server.
The recovery mechanism will resolve any disruptions caused by this action, ensuring that the server restarts as a fully functional TypeDB instance with no corruption.
// ^ Any disruptions - no. An ongoing write query will not be recovered.
[#commit_interruption]
== Is it safe to interrupt commits?

Yes.
Although it is not recommended, interrupting a commit process (e.g., by killing the server) is handled by the recovery mechanism.
~~The database will remain in the correct state it was in before the commit, ensuring data integrity.~~
// ^It is not guaranteed that the state will be how it was before the commit. Recovery will attempt to commit.
